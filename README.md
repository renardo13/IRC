### IRC

This project implements a multi-user chat server and client in C++. It demonstrates fundamental networking concepts such as sockets, client-server communication, and message handling. Users can join channels, send messages, and manage connections concurrently.

### Bonus

An additional bot has been implemented that plays Rock-Paper-Scissors with users, showcasing event-driven interaction and automated responses within the IRC environment.
